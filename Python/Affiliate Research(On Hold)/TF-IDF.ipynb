reading content for our readership.', 'Many of whom are familiar with the workings for a website running on WordPress.', 'This guide is intended to help anyone who is creating their first website, likely with WordPress.', 'Its the platform we recommend and use for our website.', 'A step by step tutorial we start off with finding the right content management system, choosing a domain name, then the right web hosting service, adding the right themes, plugins and customizing your sites appearance.', 'By the time you are done with this how to make a WordPress website for beginners guide youll have a full fledged website ready to go!Choose the right platform for your websiteSTEP 2Choose the right website name domain and hostingSTEP 3Configure your newly created WordPress websiteA content management system CMS in simple terms, is a platform of sorts or a mechanism which permits you to create your content and publish it on a website.', 'Lets say that it is a coat hanger stand with the coat being your content.', 'It is software that is installed on your hosts server.', 'Your host provider will likely have a one click installation process to help you get your CMS installed.', 'Once it is installed, you can log in to your site as the admin and add photos, text and other content.', 'You can use the content youve added to create blog posts and other forms of content like a product page or display a work portfolio on your website.', 'A CMS is way more than just a means to an end, you can install a theme which is a modified template to suit the specific niche and purpose of your site.', 'With the template added, you can customize the appearance of your site.', 'You can add plugins to add function to your site, for example a social sharing plugin to help spread the word about your site via social networks.', 'All of this and more can be accomplished with a Content Management System.', 'An overwhelming majority of websites use WordPress.', 'The other two options that lag way behind in comparison to WordPress certainly in popularity are Joomla and Drupal.', 'The ideal option for someone whos creating his or her first website.', 'It has considerable scalability and works well with low and medium traffic websites.', 'We receive 1.', '5 million views every month and we run WordPress, so that gives you an idea of what medium traffic constitutes if you were wondering.', 'Even large websites such as TIME Magazine, CNN, TED, Techcrunch, NBC and others use WordPress to server millions of pageviews each day.', 'WordPress has a great number of points that can be made in favor of its use.', 'Two not so quite favorable things about WordPressAs you can see WordPress is by far the most popular content management system and is used by 65 CMS powered websites worldwide.', 'The thing you need to know is all CMSs have one drawback or the other.', 'And for a new web admin, WordPress is the best way to go!', 'But Ill talk about Drupal and Joomla, all the same.', 'You should certainly be aware of them, should you decide to switch your CMS at a later point in time.', 'And it will also tell you why perhaps Joomla and Drupal are not best suited to the needs of beginner.', 'Unlike WordPress, Drupal is not too well suited for the technically inept or a first time website developer.', 'Drupal is an open source CMS and is largely utilized by big corporations with vast websites and high traffic loads.', 'It has its own customization possibilities with themes and plugins created to add value to Drupal sites.', 'Drupal websites are a bit faster and little less taxing on the hosts server resources.', 'But if youre new to web development, it isnt for you.', 'Why?', 'It is more complicated than it needs to be to meet your requirements.', 'It is designed for complex, vast websites with high traffic loads, which your new website will not be to begin with.', 'Given that, there is no need to add to the difficulty of the website creation process unnecessarily.', 'And besides, you can always switch to Drupal at a later date.', 'Open source and free like the previous two platforms.', 'It is a tad better than the other two when it comes to creating a community of users like a small social network or tight knit community for your readers and is far more amenable to creating social websites with a lot of interaction and engagement from users.', 'It is easier to handle than Drupal and offers more than WordPress in terms of performance and tweakability.', 'And again my reasons are the same for not recommending it for you, unnecessary complication that you do not need.', 'If you are starting off with a new domain name with no traffic so to speak of, you are better off with WordPress.', 'It is exceedingly easy to use, it is free and comes with an enormous number of premium quality free themes and plugins.', 'The cost of hosting is low and many hosts provide for easy one click installation of WordPress.', 'And since a growing percentage of online entrepreneurs do not know how to program in HTML, CSS and PHP, WordPress is the best choice as it offers excellent customizability even to WordPress newbies.', 'Do not get confused with WordPress.', 'com, which is a blog site built with WordPress.', 'What you are building here is a yoursitename.', 'com as opposed to yoursitename.', 'WordPress.', 'com.', 'And if you do not know the differences between the two, please read this post that elaborates differences between two.', 'Thank you for visiting Colorlib and reading this article!', 'We highly appreciate it!', 'Now you might want to learn how to make a website using our free WordPress themes.', 'Now that you have chosen the best platform for your website you can proceed with the next step.', 'Before you choose a domain name, youll need be sure of the niche youd like to concentrate on.', 'Selecting a niche area to focus on, is an important task in and of itself.', 'To create a revenue generating website it is critical that you research the target keyword pool and the niche it is derived from.', 'For the time being, just make sure it is something you like and are genuinely passionate about.', 'And ensure that you have reasonable expertise in the subject matter involved.', 'You can literally register any available not registered yet domain name but here is something I recommend:Most popular domain names extensions the end part of website address, like .', 'com are .', 'com, .', 'org, .', 'net, but in recent years a huge amount of new domain extensions have been introduced Wikipedia.', 'Now you can register crazy domain names such as YourCompanyName.', 'pizza, YourCompanyName.', 'green, or YourName.', 'ninja.', 'However, for your first website I recommend to stick with .', 'com, .', 'net and .', 'org.', 'New domain extensions havent gone mainstream yet and might confuse your visitors.', 'Even some social networks, services and apps have problems displaying these new domain names thats why I advice to avoid them, at least for now.', 'The next step in our process involves choosing a domain name.', 'A domain name is basically the URL one types into a browsers address bar to visit a particular website.', 'Getting the right domain name is crucial.', 'A few things you need to keep in mind while considering domain name choices.', 'Here are some domain names someone have registered without realizing what a huge mistake they have made:1.', 'Now to get yourself a domain, you need a domain registrar.', 'A domain registrar is basically someone or an organisation that reserves your right to use a domain for a given period of time.', 'Normally web hosting companies perform the function of a domain registrar in addition to being a web hosting service provider.', 'So you do not have to be concerned with this specifically as your web hosting service will also play the role of domain registrar.', 'This option is great if you have multiple domains and tend to switch your hosting provider regularly.', 'Not that we would recommend it but it does happen.', 'Also it is more secure to keep your hosting separated from domain registrar.', 'In case your hosting accounts gets compromised hackers wont get access to your domain.', '2.', 'If you are exceedingly confident of your ability to generate revenue, you might consider buying a domain name that has been parked by someone else.', 'For various reasons, sometimes the premium you end up paying for a domain name may be well worth the expense.', 'You can buy domain names on Flippa.', 'com or Godaddy.', 'com but consider this wisely, we wouldnt want you to pay a hefty price only to find out that the domain name isnt worth it later.', 'Thank you for visiting Colorlib and reading this article!', 'We highly appreciate it!', 'Now you might want to learn how to make a website using our free WordPress themes.', 'You really have two options when it comes to hosting provider types recommended for WordPress newbies.', 'I do not recommend anything other than a shared hosting plan for first time webmasters.', 'All other forms of hosting that you may have heard of like Virtual Private Hosting requires reasonable technical know how, managed WordPress hosting too costly might not be the right choice for your first website.', 'As your knowledge and business grows you might consider VPS or fully managed WordPress hosting but lets leave that for another post.', 'Shared hosting is the way to go and later we can talk about upgrading your host.', 'Weve recommended two shared hosting services and have also added elaborate installation processes for WordPress with both of them.', 'Both hosting providers offers domain registration and website hosting and thats exactly what we need to create an awesome website.', 'To make WordPress installation process easier we have created a short video that will guide you through installation process.', 'Click here to visit Bluehost and proceed with your first website setup.', 'If you had some problems understanding setup process outlined in video you can follow steps below.', 'SiteGrouds shared hosting plan has a similar, equally easy to use WordPress installation and domain registration process.', 'The site asks you whether you have a domain name or need to register one, in our case since you are creating your first site you need to register a domain.', 'Following the domain registration you can follow this easy to use this three step tutorial for a guided WordPress installation.', 'It is best to select Get WordPress Preinstalled in this account and you will not need to get your hands dirty.', 'Youll need to set admin email ID, username and password, youre set!Really anyones pick, I suggest that you have a look at both and decide based on which ever domain registration and WordPress installation process seems easier.', 'But personally I feel it doesnt matter much and you shouldnt worry too much over which of the two hosting services to go with.', 'If youd like a far more elaborate list of shared hosting service providers, check out our WordPress hosting guide.', 'Now that your domain is registered, hosting paid for and your WordPress installed.', 'Whats next?Your WordPress admin menu is available on the left side of the screen.', 'Allowing your cursor to linger over them will open sub menus.', 'That is a lot of stuff which you deal with.', 'But Ive promised to get your site up and running.', 'So for the purposes of this post I will not be talking about Settings, Tools, Users or Your Dashboard.', 'I will talk about the rest of the menu options which are part of your WordPress menu.', 'Lets get started.', 'Widgets are preset modules or pieces of code that add to a certain function which will prove useful for your website in some capacity or the other.', 'Your sidebars, footers and headers can be loaded with widgets.', 'As you can see in the above screenshot, there 6 widgets in the sidebar.', 'These widgets include a search bar, a recent posts widget, recent comments, archives, categories and meta.', 'Then you can see 4 footer areas where you can add widgets just the same.', 'The number of footer, header and sidebar areas available to you depends on the theme you are using.', 'Widgets are not plugins, but they are small chunks of code that add a bit of function.', 'Sometimes it may help with navigation, sometimes with social media, you can even use to add HTML to a text widget which will function as coded to do so.', 'So widgets are a very useful tool but you need to learn a bit about them before you can use them to the fullest.', 'Menus are an extremely important for any website.', 'They offer a means to navigate your site and its content.', 'After all, whats the point in creating captivating content if your visitor can not find it easily on your site.', 'Bad menus and navigation can lead to a high bounce rate the number of visitors as a percentage who leave your site after just viewing just one page.', 'You may have seen websites with menus on the top or the side and even at the bottom.', 'We can do all of this.', 'Youd like to include pages like About, Blog, Contact and Our Services as part of your primary menu.', 'Any page youd like displayed on your menu can be added.', 'The number of menus and their placement on your site depends on your WordPress theme.', 'You can add all the stuff that you see on the left to the menu ranging from pages to products as part of your menu.', 'Again what you can include as part of the menu depends on your WordPress theme.', 'A good menu, Keep that in mind and you should be fine.', 'Many website choose to have plain single color background and I am big fan of that.', 'The Colorlib blog has a plain white background and it keeps things simple.', 'But the homepage of the site is pretty awesome with a purple background and our tagline.', 'Websites that are media heavy, examples would include photography sites or portfolio websites have great backgrounds.', 'If you want your website to send across a powerful visual cue to your audience use a powerful background image.', 'Else you can simply opt for a plain color which is appropriate for any blog that emphasizes readability.', 'A background should not be confused with a slider image which is basically a constantly changing image that moves across or your screen or changes with fancy animation.', 'Plugins are a scripts or pieces of code written to perform a very specific function or set of functions on your website.', 'A simple example would be social sharing plugin, it helps share your content across different social platforms and helps get the word out that your content is awesome.', 'Similarly, people have developed plugins for search engine optimization, security purposes, creating and maintaining a portfolio of images, to create contact forms, for caching the list is endless.', 'If you want to read a detailed list of plugins that we think is absolutely essential, read this comprehensive list of essential plugins.', 'Pages on a website help divide your website into a requisite number of pieces to present the different sections of your sites content.', 'Pages are to themes like widgets are to plugins.', 'With pages you can create specific template styles that can be called on command for different purposes that require the same or similar design.', 'Pages are more than posts and are used for specific purposes on your site.', 'You can create pages specifically to cater to the requirements of a Contact Us Page or perhaps create landing page.', 'And you are greeted by a New Page, which you can now fill up.', 'From this new screen, you can create a new page and assign page attributes.', 'If you either need to create a template that youre likely to use often or need to recreate a section of your site for a specific purpose, creating a page is the way to go.', 'Websites need readers to make them successful.', 'Comments are a very powerful means to establish a great debate on your site and this only further adds value to your site.', 'Hardly, one percent of the traffic that visits your site will ever comment.', 'And that is assuming that the content is great to begin with.', 'Driving interaction with passive readers on your site is difficult and takes time and effort.', 'A great post with a pre-existing comment history helps your site receive more comments.', 'Aigars wrote an awesome post on Colorlib a while back, yet till this day it still keeps receiving comments and continues to be a great source of traffic.', 'And remember, WordPress allows you to link your site when you comment on another persons blog.', 'And this may send visitors your way, if you play your cards right and make genuine attempts to offer something constructive.', 'For this same reason, many people will leave their comments on your blog as well.', 'If I feel your content is great and a particular post that youve written is awesome, then Ill almost jump at the chance to leave my comment first and best anyone else to first comment.', 'Because I know eventually it will lead a few visitors back to my site.', 'Comments are a great way to build an awesome readership and a loyal following for your site.', 'Content is king may be a cliched line.', 'But it is true now more so than ever before.', 'There are many more websites now than there ever were before.', 'You name a niche, any niche and it is bound to be saturated to the hilt with websites producing content about said niche.', 'WordPress is a very profitable niche.', 'Why?', '50 of websites use it and many of them are new to WP.', 'WordPress newbies and even intermediate level users require a few resources to help them get started up and make changes to their WordPress sites, not too dissimilar to the content on Colorlib But a website like Colorlib works well and generates revenue only when we offer value to our readers.', 'We publish a great number of articles on premium WordPress themes and should you choose to buy one of them after clicking on our links we receive a small commission on your purchase.', 'But truth be told, our most popular and widely read articles arent the ones that describe premium WordPress themes or plugins, rather they are WordPress tutorials and posts dedicated to free themes, plugins and other WordPress related articles.', 'Because it is only when we offer value to readers that our site grows.', 'So based on your sites niche and your expertise, you need to produce content that genuinely offers value to would be readers.', 'If you intend to create your site purely for monetary purposes, it will not be successful in the long run.', 'No wait a minute, it may still be profitable but certainly not as successful as it could have been had you tried to genuinely help your audiences.', 'So focus on good content.', 'Pick your niche and offer great value to your readers.', 'And watch your traffic grow steadily and if you are lucky, perhaps even go through the roof!So how do you publish your content on WordPress?', 'What are the formats available to you apart from just plain ol text?The beating heart of your site or most sites anyway.', 'At the end of this tutorial when alls said and done, youll be here to populate your site with posts.', 'WordPress has a very easy to use posting mechanism and this one of the reasons, it is so popular.', 'You have two ways in which you can write your posts: one is the visual editor and the other is HTML editor.', 'You can opt to use the visual editor to begin with, but you should know the HTML editor referred to as text editor is a very powerful tool to help you create the right formatting for your posts.', 'The sooner you are comfortable with the text editor, the better of you will be.', 'You may notice I am using the visual editor and truth be told, once Ive added all the necessary formatting I prefer the visual editor.', 'The visual editor is very much similar to most text editors and permits you to add bold / italic effects to your text, change its font, add bulleted lists and numbered lists, align content differently and add hyperlinks.', 'There is also a distraction free writing mode which gives you a fullscreen version of the editor.', 'Categories are a means to divide your content.', 'Categories are important when your site publishes content on a number of issues.', 'You can add categories from your Post editor or you can access it under Posts Categories.', 'Now you can name the category to create one and then you can add a slug which is basically a URL add on of sorts for all your sites posts on that specific category.', 'For example, if I know that Colorlib produces a lot of theme collection content, I can Google search Colorlib + collections and the first search result link is https://colorlib.', 'com/wp/category/collections/ .', 'With this I can view only the posts that have been published under the category, Collections.', 'So it is a very effective way to divide your sites content and make finding stuff on your site much easier for a visitor.', 'Tags are very similar to categories, except each post generally has its own set of tags.', 'Tags are a tad more specific than categories but that apart they are the same and they aid in helping visitors find your content more easily.', 'Media as in photos and videos are important to normal websites.', 'They are even more so for media heavy websites.', 'Adding media is easy with WordPress.', 'You can either add media from Posts or you can add media directly to the media library.', 'You can add the image title, a caption, description to the image.', 'But it is also important you also add the alt text which helps search engines identify your image.', 'It is a small step in ensuring good search engine optimization.', 'There a lot of effects and stuff you can do to your imagery like make it pop up or use a lightbox with WordPress plugins.', 'But thats for another day.', 'Setting up your WordPress profile.', 'This is rather easy to deal with.', 'You can edit your profile from the Edit Your Profile on your WordPress admin screen on the top right hand corner.', 'You can describe yourself and add the necessary social media links as well.', 'And to add a profile picture for your WordPress ID, youll need to get a Gravatar account.', 'Youll need an account from WordPress.', 'com with which you can login to your sites admin panel.', 'We have far too many inhibitions, starting stuff is one of them.', 'It opens the door to failure.', 'Creating the website and generating revenue is no joke.', 'It is hard work, sometimes seemingly unrewarding work.', 'Over the next few weeks and months, well be launching

'Before moving on, I want to make the distinction between domain registration and hosting very clear.', 'They are two completely separate things; many companies just happen to offer both as a service.', 'The situation is similar to city parking garages that also offer cars for sale.', 'You could buy a car from one of them and also store your car in their garage, but you could also store your car in another garage because the car is legally yours.', 'Hosting is essentially a place to put your websites files.', 'Registering a domain means youve gained legal ownership of a piece of Internet real estate.', 'If youre new to this, you might be confused about the difference between WordPress.', 'com and WordPress.', 'org.', 'To clear this up, lets start with what WordPress is.', 'WordPress is an open-source software package and is free to everyone around the world.', 'WordPress.', 'org is the central location for the WordPress software project.', 'You can download it, view the documentation, ask and answer questions in the forums and more.', 'WordPress.', 'com is a service that offers websites that run on WordPress.', 'You can sign up for a free account and get a fully

water system.', 'You could dig a well for yourself if you have the machinery and the know-how, but you could also get a professional to do it.', 'Youre not actually paying for the water or the well itself youre paying for the service of forming the well.', 'This is just like WordPress.', 'com.', 'Youre not paying to use WordPress the software.', 'Youre paying for use of a subdomain, file hosting and management of the software which is kept up to date automatically.', 'If you want to test the waters and get started with WordPress with minimal fuss, then WordPress.', 'com is a great way to go!The free version gives you everything you need.', 'When youre ready to step into the realm of advanced customization, with your own domain name and other options, then you can go for the premium version or get your own hosting plan elsewhere.', 'Choosing a hosting package can be difficult, even for seasoned veterans of the net.', 'In this article, Ill omit options that are clearly for huge websites or ones with highly customized needs.', 'Switching hosts is easy enough, so you can change at any time.', 'There are three ways to go if youre looking for a good package:The one you pick will depend on your websites needs and your funds.', 'Lets look at what these are and their pros and cons.', 'shared hosting is an attractive option because of economies of scale.', 'A single server can house hundreds of websites, which translates to hundreds of users.', 'A single server is not that expensive to run, so the costs can be split between all users of the server.', 'Because of this, you will see shared plans for around 5 a month.', 'While this is a great price to get started, there are numerous downsides the largest of which is the bad-neighbor effect.', 'Because hundreds of websites are running from the same hardware, what happens if theres a coding bug in one of them that causes it to use up to 80 of available memory?', 'The remaining websites which could be hundreds will grind to a halt and could become unavailable.', 'The same issue arises with security; some attacks aim for a single website and end up affecting all of the other websites on the same server.', 'This boils down to decreased security and poorer uptime.', 'Whats most frustrating is that these problems are unpredictable.', 'The only reason to use shared hosting is if you are on a very tight budget and every dollar counts.', 'It can work just fine, and your website will probably not go down for hours or days on end.', 'Still, your website going down just as a potential client is viewing it could ruin a potential deal.', 'If you think shared hosting is for you, then a number of companies are available to choose from.', 'I recommend testing the support services of these companies; with shared hosts, these can be your most important asset.', 'A virtual private server or VPS is similar to a shared environment, without the negative side effects.', 'The hardware is still shared, but usually among a few users only, and the hardware is partitioned equally.', 'Another account on the same server cannot use up to 80 of the resources.', 'If four accounts are on the server, each one may use only 25 of the assets.', 'This effectively takes care of the unpredictability issues.', 'Attackers also have much more trouble accessing other accounts on the server through a single website.', 'It is possible in very rare cases, but it is not something you should worry about.', 'Because you have your own corner of a server, you are free to do more with your account than you can with a shared host.', 'This includes more server administration options, installation of tools, SSH access and more.', 'While some VPS accounts cost 5, you will generally pay around 15 to 20 per month.', 'If you have the money, then definitely do choose either managed WordPress hosting or a VPS over a shared environment.', 'VPS gives you the most flexibility out of the bunch.', 'If you plan on trying out other content management systems, such as Joomla, Drupal or Laravel, then managed WordPress hosting is out of the question because it supports only WordPress.', 'In a nutshell, if youd like to be able to meddle with your server, install other packages and learn about your server, then go for a VPS.', 'A bunch of VPS providers are out there.', 'Here are some of the best-reviewed ones:Managed WordPress hosting is a bit different because its not a different way of using server technology.', 'A managed WordPress package is actually very similar to getting a website from WordPress.', 'com, which itself can be considered a managed WordPress host.', 'In this case, the servers entire architecture is tuned to work with WordPress as efficiently as possible.', 'From memory to processors to server software and server-level caching, everything is geared to a single software package: WordPress.', 'This makes your website a lot faster and more secure as well.', 'Automatic updates, server-level caching and truly professional WordPress-specific support are just some of the benefits of managed WordPress hosting.', 'The downside is a minor loss of flexibility.', 'You cant install any other platforms on these systems, and some plugins might be disabled by the host, usually for reasons of security or optimization.', 'In short, you have less leg room than with a VPS.', 'Again, if youre new to websites, you neednt worry much about this.', 'If you dont want to meddle with server settings and you just need a well-oiled WordPress website that is maintained for you, then this hosting solution is a great option.', 'You wont need to muck about with installing WordPress and making sure it is safe, secure and fast; all of that is built right in.', 'You can start creating content within minutes and focus on what really matters.', 'WordPress hosts are becoming increasingly popular.', 'The best-known and best-rated ones are these:By now, you should have a hosting package and a domain name.', 'If youve bought a domain through your hosting provider, then you can probably skip this step because it is taken care of automatically.', 'The domain needs to be pointed to the hosting provider so that when someone accesses it through their browser, they are directed to the appropriate server.', 'This is most often done using nameservers, sometimes referred to as account DNS.', 'Youll need to log into the website that you registered your domain with and change the nameservers for the domain.', 'With Media Temple, you can add nameservers using a simple form.', 'Your host will tell you what nameservers to specify.', 'My SiteGround account has the following information:Whenever you change your nameservers, you will have to wait up to 72 hours for them to take effect.', 'The lag will also depend on where you are relative to the server.', 'Ive found that if the server is in the US and Im in Europe, the website will work fine within a couple of hours when viewed from within the US.', 'The changes usually take more time to propagate overseas.', 'Nowadays, especially with managed WordPress hosting, you might be a bit confused about how to add a website to your host.', 'You might be able to add multiple WordPress installations without ever seeing a screen asking What domain do you want?This can work in many ways.', 'Lets look at a specific way to understand the difference between websites and domains.', 'Lets assume you have a fresh managed WordPress account.', 'You can probably add multiple websites, and all youd be asked is the name of the WordPress installation and your user details.', 'Once this website is created, it can already be reached, usually through a subdomain, like wnub234.', 'wpengine.', 'com.', 'This allows you to fully set up the website without even owning a domain.', 'If you want to refer to the website with your own domain, like awesomesite.', 'com instead of the ugly wnub234.', 'wpengine.', 'com, then you will need to add a domain and assign it to the website.', 'The last step is to make sure you set the nameservers of your domain to the nameservers of your host.', 'This way, users will be routed to the correct website when accessing the domain.', 'If you have a managed WordPress host, youll be able to do this by filling out a simple form.', 'Depending on your account type, you might be able to add any number of WordPress installations to your account.', 'With Kinsta, youd fill out a quick form and then youd be done:If you have a shared or a VPS account, then you have two choices: one-click installation or manual installation.', 'Many hosts offer WordPress installation tools to minimize the work in this step.', 'If you need to take the manual root, dont worry: Its not difficult!', 'All youll need to do is download WordPress, upload all of the files to your domains folder, create a database, point your browser to the domain and follow the on-screen instructions.', 'The WordPress Codex has a complete installation guide.', 'If youre stuck or need help creating a database, take a look at it and youll be done in no time!Its time to get our hands dirty and start setting up our actual website from within WordPress.', 'First, I want to mention a couple of things about how WordPress works.', 'Im sure youll notice that many people say they dislike WordPress for various reasons, such as bad security, a theme not working or their website becoming very slow.', 'In reality, WordPress is a great system just like many other systems, no matter how small or large the website.', 'The problems you hear about, like poor security, pages grinding to a halt or a bad user interfaces on the front end, are almost exclusively due to poorly coded plugins and themes.', 'As a result, the theme and plugins you choose matter a lot.', 'You know how some people have really slow computers and complain about them all day?', 'Then you take a look and see that theyve installed every single piece of shady software available?', 'The situation is kind of like that.', 'Coming across a theme or a plugin with malicious intent is pretty rare.', 'More often than not, the problems one creates are caused by sloppiness or insufficient knowledge of coding standards.', 'What this all boils down to is this: Look for a theme and plugins with good reviews, a sizeable user base and an active development team.', 'This will negate or minimize any negative impact on your website.', 'Choosing a theme is, in many ways, the most difficult task of all.', 'Plugins are usually more specific: You install one to perform a single task.', 'While themes simply add the visuals for the front page, testing them can be more complex.', 'A theme has parts you might not think of testing, such as the 404 page, the search page, the archive and so on.', 'In addition, some themes boast a lot of features, like support for WooCommerce, bbPress and so on.', 'Code quality affects the speed of your website, which, along with the design, affects your users directly.', 'Depending on what type of website you have a personal blog, a store, a forum, etc.', ', you will also need some plugins.', 'These work in conjunction with your theme and WordPress back end to provide specific functionality.', 'Lets go over a few common setups.', 'WooCommerce has become the standard plugin to use for e-commerce.', 'It contains everything you need to start an online business right out of the box.', 'bbPress is a powerful if somewhat old-fashioned plugin for forums.', 'Once its installed, you and your users can create categories and threads and post replies.', 'Management is easy from within WordPress administrative back end.', 'WordPress even allows you to create your own social network with BuddyPress.', 'You get many of the same features youre used to on Facebook: profiles, groups, activity streams, notifications, friend connections, private messages and so on.', 'Once you have your base plugins you can use any number of them together, I recommend adding some content in the back end.', 'This will make it much easier to gauge your theme.', 'If youre using bbPress, create some forums, threads and answers.', 'Create multiple users and answer different questions with each of them.', 'If youre using WooCommerce, add some products with nice images and fill out the details.', 'One limitation is that you wont know the capabilities of these plugins.', 'This makes testing nearly impossible, especially if youre also trying to get to grips with a theme.', 'My recommendation is this.', 'If you are new to WordPress or a particular plugin, always test it using a default theme, such as Twenty Fifteen.', 'Twenty Fifteen is particularly good because it is a clean, minimal theme that is coded by the WordPress team and supports all plugins.', 'Not all features will look perfect, but functionality-wise you will be able to test everything.', 'Once you understand the theme and the plugin, you can choose a different theme and test the waters there.', 'Youll notice any missing functionality and any unstyled elements.', 'What Ive noticed during my 10 years of working with WordPress is that there is almost no such thing as a perfect theme, just as there is no such thing as a perfect line of clothing in a large apparel store.', 'You might like a coat better if it was an inch longer or like your shoes more if they had a subtly different curve.', 'The only way to get truly perfect clothes is to have them made specifically for you, which is extremely expensive.', 'The same with WordPress themes.', 'The reason they are usually not perfect is because they are made to serve a large user base.', 'If a theme is perfect for you, then it probably lacks features for other people.', 'You can get a perfect theme if you get a developer to make one for you, but that is expensive.', 'At the beginning, I suggest settling for a 90 perfect theme.', 'In many cases, what a website owner perceives as being imperfect does not make much of a difference to users.', 'Website speed and easy navigation count for far more than visual perfection.', 'Get a theme that is close enough, and tweak it using settings and plugins.', 'Perhaps get a developer to make tiny modifications, but dont dwell on it too much.', 'You can always switch themes or get a theme made for you when you have the funds.', 'There are some guidelines for choosing a good theme, many of which you can tick off with some research.', 'The basics are these:Contrary to popular belief, free themes arent of lower quality than premium themes.', 'Youll find amazing and horrible themes in both categories.', 'It comes down to the effort of the coding team behind the theme, not the price tag.', 'In many cases, assessing the quality of a premium theme is easier.', 'Because people have paid money for it, they will be much more likely to rate and comment on the theme than users of free themes.', 'Many premium marketplaces also have open forums where themes can be discussed.', 'You can even talk to the seller before buying their theme.', 'This makes it a bit easier to evaluate.', 'If youd like to look at some premium theme marketplaces, here are some popular ones:In this section, I thought Id show you some great plugins that many WordPress users install without thinking.', 'Some of these are great for displaying content, some of them add social features, some of them secure your website, and some are just plain helpful.', 'If youd like to optimize your content to maximize the search-engine love it receives, then youll need an SEO plugin, and All in One SEO Pack is a great choice.', 'Once its installed, you can set a lot of meta information for your website and for individual posts.', 'Youll be able to preview how a page looks in Google results and various other important bits and pieces that go into optimizing content.', 'Backing up and restoring will be a large part of your efforts related to security.', 'Dropbox Backup Restore automates this task for you.', 'It creates a full backup of all of your files and your database, either locally or to Dropbox.', 'Whatever backup solution you use, make sure to store your backups off the server.', 'If the hard drive of your server fails, then your backups will disappear as well, of course.', 'While not free, my favourite plugin for backing up is VaultPress.', 'It was created by the good people at Automattic, the company that manages WordPress, which means it integrates with the system completely.', 'It ties together with a backup service that takes care of everything automatically.', 'You dont even have to click Back up; the task runs on schedule, and you can restore everything with a single click.', 'Plans start at 5 a month, which is a bargain if you rely on your website to make money.', 'In addition to the backup service, the plugin also keeps tabs on your websites security and visitor statistics.', 'Akismet comes preinstalled with all WordPress installations.', 'It is a plugin tied to a service that ensures your websites comments section remains spam free.', 'The power of Akismet is that it is cloud-based.', 'It uses data gathered about spammers across millions of websites to provide more effective spam protection than anything you could do locally.', 'Using Akismet is free, but please consider going for the paid option if you rely on your website to make money.', 'Akismet is a great service and deserves some love, too!Caching can speed up a website considerably by serving static pages instead of dynamic ones.', 'A single post will generally not change, unless you update the post or someone posts a comment.', 'This kind of page can be saved as is, and WordPress will be able to serve the saved version much faster than by assembling the page using server-side code and database queries each time.', 'Whenever the page does change, the saved version is updated.', 'W3 Total Cache is a well-known and high-performance caching solution that brings the best out of your website.', 'Note that you can tweak a lot of settings, and in rare cases some of them could slow down your website.', 'If you look at the documentation and manipulate only a few things at a time, everything will be just fine.', 'Jetpack is a monster plugin that has become so feature-rich that it actually takes up more space than WordPress itself.', 'This is not a problem because it provides some genuinely great functionality.', 'From contact forms to social-sharing buttons to improved galleries, Jetpack offers a huge range of features.', 'If you want to add a contact form or any sort of information-gathering form to your website, you have a number of options, one of which is Ninja Forms.', 'You can set up all of the fields you need, add CAPTCHAs and other security measures, and then wait for the responses to flow.', 'Best of all, responses are not only sent your way via email; they are stored in WordPress for future reference!One aspect of security is backing up; another is actively preventing threats.', 'This is where a plugin like iThemes Security comes in.', 'It monitors user logins, adds two-factor authentication, sets passwords to expire, monitors files for changes, obscures parts of the website to hide them from malicious code and much more!Most features are set-and-forget, so you can set up the plugin once and be a lot safer as a result!Thousands upon thousands of plugins are in the repository for any scenario you could think of.', 'Every plugin Ive mentioned has dozens of alternatives that you might like better.', 'It pays to try new things and keep your eyes open!Look at reviews, the latest release date, the developers website, documentation and the product itself to gauge whether one is right for you.', 'And dont forget: You can change a plugin any time if you arent happy!Weve covered many of the basics with the backup and security plugins mentioned above, but I want to dedicate a section to some simple rules to follow, because getting this right is so important.', 'Hackers always follow the path of least resistance.', 'They look for common flaws that are easy to exploit.', 'In fact, you can probably get by all right by following these two simple rules:If you follow these rules, you will bypass 99 of all attempts on your website.', 'To circumvent the remaining 1, you can use a variety of tactics, some of them simple, some requiring a bit more work.', 'Smashing Magazine has a pretty extensive article on securing your WordPress website.', 'If you are worried about security or want to do more, take a look.', 'Now that everything is set up, you can finally start adding content!', 'While what you add is up to you, there are some usual bits of content, even some that you may be forced to have by law.', 'The home page is the most difficult to make.', 'WordPress allows you to create a static page or a dynamic page.', 'The default is a dynamic page that lists your ten most recent posts.', 'If youre creating an online resume or a corporate website, then you might prefer to present details about yourself or the company.', 'In this case, create a page in WordPress and set it as the home page in the Settings Reading section.', 'An About page appears on almost all websites.', 'For a personal website or blog, it can be used to tell your story, allowing users to get to know you.', 'For a corporate website, it would contain more information about the company.', 'Dont underestimate the power of this page!', 'While you might not think that the information on there is fun, important or useful, your followers and fans might well think otherwise.', 'If youre applying for a job or working as a freelancer, your employer might just have a look.',
